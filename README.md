# Smart Health: AI-Powered Monitoring for Diabetic and Heart Patients

### Why We Created Smart Health

Smart Health was created to address critical healthcare challenges faced by millions of diabetic and heart patients, particularly in developing countries where access to quality healthcare is often limited or unaffordable. Nearly 500,000 Muslim patients die each year due to lack of access to healthcare, and diabetes is one of the leading causes of death globally. Our mission was to provide life-saving healthcare technology to those who need it most, aiming to reduce preventable deaths and complications through innovative, AI-powered home monitoring solutions.

### Project Aim

Our aim was to build an accessible platform that combines artificial intelligence, real-time monitoring, and advanced medical devices to empower patients, their families, and healthcare providers. By predicting health risks before they become critical, Smart Health sought to prevent severe complications, reduce healthcare costs, and improve the quality of life for vulnerable patients, particularly those suffering from diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

### Funding Needs and Challenges

To sustain and expand the project, we needed to raise funds to cover essential costs such as cloud hosting, app development, medical device support, and a 24/7 clinical monitoring team. We launched crowdfunding campaigns to raise a total of $19.2k, starting with an urgent goal of $5.5k. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we were unable to secure the necessary funding, which has forced us to shut down the project.

### Key Components of the Project

1. **Smart Check Device**: An all-in-one, medical-grade device that provides patients with a compact, FDA-cleared tool to measure vital health signs, including:
   - Blood Pressure
   - Glucose Level
   - Pulse Rate
   - ECG
   - Body Temperature
   - Oxygen Level (SPO2)
   - Sleep Apnea
   - Physical Activity (Steps Count, Calories Used, Fat Burned)

   These measurements are fed into our AI software to predict potential health deterioration. The device can also function as a mini-monitor, providing continuous tracking of heart rate, body temperature, and oxygen levels, similar to what is found in intensive care units.

2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Software**: The AI software predicts diseases before they occur, helping identify high-risk patients and enabling preventive care. The AI uses data from the Smart Check device to automatically assess health risks and inform the clinical team, who can then provide tailored medical advice.

   - **Example**: The software can predict cardiac arrest risk based on user input and vital sign analysis. [Watch the AI in action here](https://youtu.be/s9SgSawY7pw). 
   - **Patient Analysis**: A graph showing heart attack risk increases at specific age ranges (highlighted in red) illustrates how the AI helps in early diagnosis.

3. **Mobile App (Doctor Suite)**: The app connects to supported medical devices and transfers patient vital signs in real-time to guardians and clinicians. Features include:
   - Real-time monitoring of health data
   - A diabetes diary to record daily food intake and suggest insulin units

   - **App Demonstrations**:

4. **Clinical Team Monitoring (Funding Required)**: A 24/7 clinical team was envisioned to continuously monitor patient data, providing medical advice and preventive care interventions. Due to funding constraints, this component remained underdeveloped.

### Patient Cycle Overview

1. The patient measures vital signs using the Smart Check device, which transfers data via Bluetooth to the mobile app.
2. The app sends data to the real-time web panel on the cloud.
3. Guardians and a 24/7 clinical team (if funded) monitor patient health through the app and web panel.
4. Clinical team contacts patients/guardians when abnormal signs are detected and provides medical advice or books doctor appointments.
5. Patients can grant their doctors access to their medical records, including historical data and lab results from integrated third-party labs.
6. The AI software also predicts low and high insulin levels, recommends insulin doses, and assesses pre-diabetes risk for family members.

### Why We Are Open-Sourcing This Project

Due to our inability to sustain the project financially, we have made the difficult decision to shut down Smart Health. However, we believe in the potential of our technology and the positive impact it can have on underserved communities. We are open-sourcing the entire project, including our software, knowledge, and research, in the hope that others can pick up where we left off.

### How You Can Help

This repository is now available for anyone who shares our passion for making healthcare accessible and effective for everyone, regardless of economic status. We encourage developers, healthcare professionals, and organizations to contribute, improve, and deploy these tools to help those in need.
